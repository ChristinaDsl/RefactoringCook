<Mechanics>Create a new method, and name it after the intention of the method ,name it by what it does, not by how it does it,If the code you want to extract is very simple, such as a single message or function call, you should extract it if the name of the new
method will reveal the intention of the code in a better way, If you can't come up with a more meaningful name, don't extract the code,Copy the extracted code from the source method into the new target method-Scan the extracted code for references to any variables that are local in scope to the source method, These are local variables and parameters to the method-See whether any temporary variables are used only within this extracted code, If so, declare them in the target method as temporary variables,Look to see whether any of these local-scope variables are modified by the extracted
code,If one variable is modified, see whether you can treat the extracted code as a query
and assign the result to the variable concerned, If this is awkward, or if there is more than
one such variable, you can't extract the method as it stands,Pass into the target method as parameters local-scope variables that are read from the
extracted code,Compile when you have dealt with all the locally-scoped variables,Replace the extracted code in the source method with a call to the target method,If you have moved any temporary variables over to the target method, look to see whether they were declared outside of the extracted code, If so, you can now remove the declaration,Compile and test</Mechanics>

<Mechanics>Examine all features used by the source method that are defined on the source class,Consider whether they also should be moved,If a feature is used only by the method you are about to move, you might as well move it, too, If the feature is used by other methods, consider moving them as well, Sometimes it is easier to move a clutch of
methods than to move them one at a time,Check the sub- and superclasses of the source class for other declarations of the method,If there are any other declarations, you may not be able to make the move, unless the polymorphism can also be expressed on the target,Declare the method in the target class,You may choose to use a different name, one that makes more sense in the target class,Copy the code from the source method to the target, Adjust the method to make it work in its new home,If the method uses its source, you need to determine how to reference the source object from the target method, If there is no mechanism in the target class, pass the source object reference to the
new method as a parameter,If the method includes exception handlers, decide which class
should logically handle the exception, If the source class should be
responsible, leave the handlers behind,Compile the target class,Determine how to reference the correct target object from the source,There may be an existing field or method that will give you the target, If not, see whether you can easily create a method that will do so, Failing that, you need to create a new field in the source that can store
the target, This may be a permanent change, but you can also make it
temporarily until you have refactored enough to remove it,Turn the source method into a delegating method,Compile and test,Decide whether to remove the source method or retain it as a delegating method,Leaving the source as a delegating method is easier if you have
many references,If you remove the source method, replace all the references with references to the target method,You can compile and test after changing each reference, although it is usually easier to change all references with one search and replace,Compile and test</Mechanics>

may be a permanent change, but you can also do it temporarily until you
have refactored enough to remove it,Remove the field on the source class,Replace all references to the source field with references to the appropriate method on the target,For accesses to the variable, replace the reference with a call to
